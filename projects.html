        An Efficient and Flexible FPGA-Based Deep Neural Network Accelerator.
      </div>

      <div class="pub-authors">
      Designed a modular FPGA-based accelerator for convolutional neural networks,
        achieving approximately <strong>50%</strong> resource reduction and up to <strong>40x</strong> 
        efficiency improvement compared to conventional DSP-based designs. The architecture was 
        scaled to deliver up to 144 GOPS and 480 FPS with low power consumption, enabling efficient 
        AI deployment on edge devices.

      Advancing Low-Resource Language Speech Synthesis: A VITS-Based Urdu TTS System
      </div>

      <div class="pub-authors">
      Developed and fine‑tuned a VITS‑based text‑to‑speech model for Urdu, a low‑resource language, 
      using a custom dataset; demonstrates significant improvements in synthesis quality for 
      under‑resourced speech applications.
